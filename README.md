# Rabi-Fitting
This repository contains documents related to modelling optical Rabi oscillations in quantum dot exciton-biexciton excitation schemes. The available documents include:
**QuTiP Reference Doc**: A document containing a summary of QuTiP functions and applications, including a note on units in QuTiP. This is not an exhaustive tutorial document, but provides a good foundation for the tools needed to complete this project.
**Rabi Oscillation Process**: This is a very rough, informal mega-document containing the process work that led up to the completion of the Rabi Oscillation simulation. This includes iterations of the final product and variations of several tutorials available in the QuTiP notebooks.
